# ``pySciSci``

"The Science of Science (SciSci) is based on a transdisciplinary approach that uses large data sets to study the mechanisms underlying the doing of scienceâ€”from the choice of a research problem to career trajectories and progress within a field"[[1]](#1).

The ``pySciSci`` package offers a unified interface to analyze several of the most common Bibliometric DataBases used in the Science of Science, including:
| Data Set      | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/) (MAG)      | [Getting Started with MAG](/examples/Getting_Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20MAG.ipynb)       |
| [Clarivate Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/) (WoS)   | [Getting Started with WOS](/examples/Getting_Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20WOS.ipynb)        |
| [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de) | [Getting Started with DBLP](/examples/Getting_Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20DBLP.ipynb) |
| [American Physical Society](https://journals.aps.org/datasets) (APS) | [Getting Started with APS](/examples/Getting_Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20APS.ipynb) |
| [PubMed](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html) | [Getting Started with PubMed](/examples/Getting_Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20PubMed.ipynb) |
| [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) | [Getting Started with OpenAlex](/examples/Getting_Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20OpenAlex.ipynb) |


The ``pySciSci`` package also provides efficient implementations of recent metrics developed to study scientific publications and authors, including:

| Publications Metrics |  - |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Measure | Example |
| Interdisciplinarity (RoaStirling, Simpson, Finite Simpson, Shannon) |  |

- H-index
- G-index
- Disruption Index
- Author Pagerank
- Collective credit allocation
- Annual productivity trajectories
- Sleeping Beauty Coefficient
- Q-factor
- Career Topic Switching
- Field Reference Share
- Field Reference Strength
- Novelty & Conventionality
...

Advanced tools for constructing and analyzing network objects (both static and temporal):
- Citation network
- Co-citation network
- Co-authorship network
- Co-mention network
- Graph2vec network embedding

Natural Language Processing
- Publication matching
- Author matching

Visualization
- Career Timelines


## Installation

### Latest development release on GitHub

Pull and install in the current directory:

```
  pip install git+https://github.com/SciSciCollective/pyscisci
```

### Latest PyPI stable release

ToDo

## Computational Requirements

Currently, the ``pySciSci`` is built ontop of pandas, and keeps entire dataframes in working memory.  We have found that most large-scale analyzes 
can be performed on a personal computer with extended RAM.  If you dont have enough computational power, consider a smaller database (DBLP or APS), or running on a cloud computing platform (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, etc).

We also support basic Dask implemenations for multiprocessing.  [An example notebook can be found here.](/examples/Getting_Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20a%20Dask%20Example.ipynb)
