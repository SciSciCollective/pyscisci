# pySciSci

Note: Package is currently under construction.

"The Science of Science (SciSci) is based on a transdisciplinary approach that uses large data sets to study the mechanisms underlying the doing of scienceâ€”from the choice of a research problem to career trajectories and progress within a field"[[1]](#1).

The ``pySciSci`` package offers a unified interface to analyze several of the most common Bibliometric DataBases used in the Science of Science, including:
- [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/) (MAG)
- [Clarivate Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/) (WoS)
- [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de)
- [American Physical Society](https://journals.aps.org/datasets) (APS)
- [PubMed](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html)

The ``pySciSci`` also provides efficient implemntations of recent metrics developed to study scientific publications and authors, including:
- H-index
- Disruption Index
- Author Pagerank
- Collective credit allocation
- Interdisciplinarity (RoaStirling)
- Annual productivity trajectories
- Novelty & Conventionality, ToDo
- Q-factor, ToDo
...

Advanced tools for constructing and analyzing network objects (both static and temporal):
- Citation network
- Co-citation network
- Co-authorship network
- Graph2vec network embedding

Natural Language Processing
- Author matching


## Installation

### Latest development release on GitHub

Pull and install in the current directory:

```
  pip install git+git://github.com/SciSciCollective/pyscisci
```

### Latest PyPI stable release

ToDo

## Computational Requirements

Currently, the ``pySciSci`` is built ontop of pandas, and keeps entire dataframes in working memory.  We have found that most large-scale analyzes require more computational power and RAM than available on a typical personal computer.   Consider running on a cloud computing platform (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, etc).

ToDo: explore Dask and pySpark implemenations for multiprocessing.
